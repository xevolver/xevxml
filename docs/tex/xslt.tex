\chapter{AST Transformation Rules}\label{chap:xslt}

XevXML represents an AST in an XML format, and various XML tools are
hence available for AST transformation. In XevXML, a transformation rule
is (internally) represented as an XSLT rule. If a special code
transformation is needed, the most flexible and expressive way is to
write an XSLT rule for the transformation, even though high-level
interfaces are also developed for some specific purposes as described in
Chapter~\ref{chap:json}. An XSLT rule consists of XSLT template rules,
each of which is applied to an XML element if the element matches a
pattern on the XPath expression associated with the XSLT template rule.

XevXML provides some predefined XSLT template rules.  Users can
customize the predefined rules for their own purposes.  Thus, an XSLT
template rule can be used as a sample or a baseline for users to newly
define their special transformation rules.  This chapter describes how
to use and customize an XSLT rule for code transformation.


\section{Predefined Rules}\label{sec:predef}
Remember that, in XevXML, every transformation rule is internally
written in XSLT. You can write such a rule from scratch if you want.
But, a code transformation rule generally consists of many ``XSLT
template rules,'' and some of them are reusable in other code
transformation rules.  Therefore, XevXML offers some predefined XSLT
template rules that can be used as a part of a user-defined code
transformation rule.

Let's get started with a simple XSLT rule before explaining the
predefined rules.
\begin{framed}
\begin{src}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
   xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
   xmlns:exslt="http://exslt.org/common">

  <xsl:template match="/">
    <xsl:apply-templates/>
  </xsl:template>

  <xsl:template match="*">
    <xsl:copy>
      <xsl:copy-of select="@*"/>
      <xsl:apply-templates/>
    </xsl:copy>
  </xsl:template>

  <xsl:template match="SgFortranDo">
    <xsl:if test="preceding-sibling::*[1]/SgPragma/@pragma='xev loop_tag'">
      !pragma is found
    </xsl:if>
    <xsl:copy>
      <xsl:copy-of select="@*"/>
      <xsl:apply-templates mode="loopbody"/>
    </xsl:copy>
  </xsl:template>

  <xsl:template match="*" mode="loopbody">
    ! in a loop body
    <xsl:copy>
      <xsl:copy-of select="@*"/>
      <xsl:apply-templates mode="loopbody"/>
    </xsl:copy>
  </xsl:template>
</xsl:stylesheet>
\end{src}
\end{framed}

As mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:xslt}, an XSLT rule usually consists of
several ``template'' rules expressed by \texttt{$<$xsl:template$>$}
elements. In the above example, four template rules are defined. Each
template rule has a \texttt{match} attribute whose value is an XPath
expression. When an XSLT rule consisting of multiple template rules is
applied to an XML AST, every XML element in the XML AST, i.e.~every AST
node, is visited once in a depth-first manner. Then, if an XML element
matches the XPath expression given by the \texttt{match} attribute of a
template rule, the template rule is applied to the matched XML element.

In the above example, the XPath expression of the first template rule,
i.e.,~\texttt{/}, matches only the root node of an XML AST that is an
\texttt{$<$SgSourceFile$>$} element. Therefore, its rule is applied to
the root node, and \texttt{$<$xsl:apply-templates$>$} is called for
its child nodes.

The second template rule matches every node in the XML AST,
i.e.,~\texttt{*}, and its rule is applied to the node unless a more
specific rule matches the node.  This rule also calls
\texttt{$<$xsl:apply-templates$>$} for every child node.

The third template rule matches only an \texttt{$<$SgFortranDo$>$}
element. This uses an \texttt{$<$xsl:if$>$} element to check if the
XPath expression given by its \texttt{test} attribute is true. The
expression is true only if
\begin{itemize}
 \item The preceding sibling element of the \texttt{$<$SgFortranDo$>$}
       element has an \texttt{$<$SgPragma$>$} element as a child node,
 \item The \texttt{$<$SgPragma$>$} element has a \texttt{pragma}
       attribute, and
 \item The attribute value is a string of "xev loop\_tag".
\end{itemize}
If all the conditions are met, the template rule inserts a comment,
``pragma is found,'' to the code before copying sub-nodes and attributes
of the matched \texttt{$<$SgFortranDo$>$} element.

In the third template rule, an \texttt{$<$xsl::apply-templates$>$}
element is used with a \texttt{mode} attribute. As a result, template
rules with the same mode are applied to the child nodes. In this
example, the fourth template rule is applied to every child node of an
\texttt{$<$SgFortranDo$>$} element, for which all the above conditions
are met. The fourth template rule instead of the second rule matches
every node if \texttt{$<$xsl::apply-templates$>$} is used with the
\texttt{loopbody} mode. In this way, different template rules can be
applied only to a subset of AST nodes.


If the third rule and/or the fourth rule is modified to transform a loop
structure and/or a loop body, the above XSLT rule can be used as a loop
transformation rule applied only to loops annotated with \texttt{"xev
loop\_tag"}. Although such a loop transformation rule could be complex,
its components, i.e.~XSLT template rules, are reusable for many
application codes.  Therefore, XevXML provides a library of predefined
XSLT template rules often required for basic loop optimizations.


In the template rule library, a code transformation rule is assumed to
be comprised of three steps. One step is initialization, which usually
finds an annotation being used to indicate where to transform. Another
step is to move onto an XML element that is the root node of a subtree
to be transformed. The other step is to transform the subtree, and print
it out in XML. The library offers several predefined rules for each
step.

Using such predefined template rules for each step, a special directive
for unrolling Loop $i$ can be defined as follow.
\begin{framed}
 \begin{src}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
  xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">

  <xsl:import href="libCHiLL.xsl" />

  <xsl:output method="xml" encoding="UTF-8" />

  <xsl:template match="*" mode="xevInitHook">
   <xsl:apply-templates select="." mode="xevFindDirective">
      <xsl:with-param name="directiveName" select="'xev loop_tag'" />
    </xsl:apply-templates>
  </xsl:template>

  <xsl:template match="*" mode="xevMoveHook">
    <xsl:apply-templates select="." mode="xevGoToLoop">
      <xsl:with-param name="loopName" select="'i'" />
    </xsl:apply-templates>
  </xsl:template>

  <xsl:template match="*" mode="xevTransformationHook">
    <xsl:apply-templates select="." mode="chillUnroll">
      <xsl:with-param name="factor" select="4" />
      <xsl:with-param name="loopName" select="'i'" />
    </xsl:apply-templates>
  </xsl:template>
</xsl:stylesheet>
\end{src}
\end{framed}

The template rule with the \texttt{xevInitHook} mode represents the
first step of the initialization. In the rule,
\texttt{$<$xsl:apply-templates$>$} is used with the
\texttt{xevFindDirective} mode. This results in using a predefined
template rule associated with the \texttt{xevFindDirective} mode, and
also finds a directive, \texttt{xev loop\_tag}.

The template rule with the \texttt{xevMoveHook} mode represents the
second step. In the rule, the \texttt{xevGoToLoop} mode is used when
calling \texttt{$<$xsl:apply-templates$>$}. This results in visiting a
loop whose index variable is \texttt{i}. The loop is to be transformed
by the template rule of the third step.

The template rule with the \texttt{xevTransformationHook} mode
represents the third step. In the rule,
\texttt{$<$xsl:apply-templates$>$} is used with the
\texttt{chillUnroll} mode for loop unrolling. The
\texttt{chillUnroll} mode needs two parameters, \texttt{factor} and
\texttt{loopName}. In this example, the third rule unrolls Loop $i$ four
times.

In this way, we can organize a custom compiler directive by directly
using XevXML's low-level interface, i.e.,~XSLT.

In the current version of XevXML, all of predefined template rules are
written for Fortran programs. It is ongoing to define such rules for C
programs.  The predefined rules currently included in the library are as
follows.

The above predefined template rules are basically designed under
assumption of the three steps defined with the \texttt{xevInitHook},
\texttt{xevMoveHook}, and \texttt{xevTransformHook} modes. But we do not
necessarily use the predefined rules for all of the three steps.  If
necessary, some steps can be manually described as in the first XSLT
example of this section. Indeed, the \texttt{xsltgen} command currently
uses predefined rules only for the third step.  The XSLT template rules
for the other two steps are written directly in individual XSLT
files. See the XSLT file generated by the \texttt{xsltgen} command for
details.
