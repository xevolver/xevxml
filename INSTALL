INSTALLATION GUIDE

1. Some environmental variables such as LD_LIBRARY_PATH, JAVA_HOME,
   and CXX must be correctly set so as to use ROSE, Xerces, and Xalan.

2. At the top diretocy of the source tree, make a directory for
   building the package.

   % mkdir mybuild
   % cd mybuild

3. Run the cmake command

   % cmake ../

   If you need to use a specific version of a library or a header
   file, you can also use environment variables CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH and
   CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH.
   For example, if you need to use a library or a header file in
   /home/user/local, define those enviromnent variables as follows.

   % export CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/user/local/lib:$CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH
   % export CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=/home/user/local/include:$CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH

   Those environment variables must be correctly set so that all of
   the necessary header files and libraries such as picojson.h and
   rose.h are found by the cmake command.

   See the cmake manual for more details.

4. Run the GNU make command.

   To compile the package,

   % make

   To install the package,

   % make install

   To test the package,

   % make test

   Some of tests will be failed. But it does not necessarily mean that
   something is wrong with the built binaries. Even if everything goes
   well, the current implementation fails in some tests. This is
   mainly because it is built on top of ROSE and unable to pass the
   tests if ROSE cannot properly parse/unparse the test codes.
