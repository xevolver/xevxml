\chapter{Internal Structures and Behaviors}\label{chap:internal}

Since ROSE already has various features of code analyses and
transformations to implement custom code transformation programs, XevXML
provides some C++ classes and functions, which are helpful to read and
write XML ASTs. As a result, code transformation programs developed with
ROSE can handle XML ASTs. 

This chapter describes XevXML classes and functions that allows ROSE to
handle XML ASTs. By inheriting the classes, users can develop customized
versions of \texttt{src2xml} and \texttt{xml2src} commands. For example,
\texttt{src2xml} would be customized so that some additional XML
attributes are written in an XML AST.
