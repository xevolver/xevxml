\chapter{AST Transformation Rules}

XevXML represents an AST in an XML format, and various XML tools are
hence available for AST transformation. In XevXML, the transformation
rules are (internally) represented as XSLT rules. If a special code
transformation is needed, the most flexible and expressive way is to
write an XSL rule for the transformation.

XevXML provides a lot of predefined rules that are also written in XSLT.
Users can customize those predefined rules for their own
purposes. XevXML also provides an XSLT rule template as a sample for
users to newly define their special transformation rules.

This chapter describes how to define and customize an XSLT rule for AST
transformation in XevXML.
